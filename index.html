                            If your favourite meat is chicken, then there are many lip-smacking options for you to go all out and indulge.It is a great source of lean, low fat protein.A chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a kind of domesticated bird. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Most breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees if there are trees around.
A male chicken is called a rooster or a cockerel. A female chicken is called a hen. A young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks.
When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this. Chickens are omnivores.The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.
Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs.

                            The term Sushi refers to foods that use a type of rice seasoned with vinegar and garnished with raw fish or vegetable. It is naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals.This article is about Japanese cuisine. For the ancient Chinese poet, see Su Shi. For other uses, see Sushi (disambiguation).
Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.
Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
